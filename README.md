<h1>Organization Reputation Manager Redux<img align="right" src="./Data/image.png" width="100px"></h1>

Content library that allows users to keep track and collect rewards from custom organizations. This content library was re-completed because the original Organization Reputation Manager was sometimes confusing to setup and so I worked with AI to better the process.

## Help
To setup the Reputation Organization Manager simply go to [import](https://github.com/Shadow-Draconic-Development/Avrae-Organization-Reputation-Manager-Redux/blob/main/Code/import/import.md)

If you have already setup the Reputation Organization Manager under the old content library, simply download this content library and run `!rep import old`.
